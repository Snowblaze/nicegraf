\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
An opaque handle to a render target object.

Render targets are collections of images that can be rendered into. Each image in the collection is referred to as an \char`\"{}attachment\char`\"{}. Some attachments have special meaning, for example the depth or the combined depth+stencil attachment, the contents of which are used in depth/stencil tests. A render target is not allowed to have multiple depth or depth+stencil attachments, however it is allowed to have multiple color attachments (up to a certain limit).
