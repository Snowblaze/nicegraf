\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
An opaque handle to an image object.

Images are multidimensional arrays of data that can be sampled from in shaders, or rendered into. The individual elements of such arrays shall be referred to as \char`\"{}texels\char`\"{}. An \mbox{\hyperlink{group__ngf_ga48bf7488f4d5c9421491c8c0b955132a}{ngf\+\_\+image\+\_\+format}} describes the specific type and layout of data elements within a single texel. Note that compressed image formats typically don\textquotesingle{}t store values of texels directly, rather they store enough information that the texel values can be reconstructed (perhaps lossily) by the rendering device.

Images can be one of the following types (see \mbox{\hyperlink{group__ngf_ga6c69d697d500e6f85fd9b3fe003f177b}{ngf\+\_\+image\+\_\+type}})\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a two-\/dimensional image, identified by \mbox{\hyperlink{group__ngf_gga6c69d697d500e6f85fd9b3fe003f177ba5343fd7c187a40afe11397162737100b}{NGF\+\_\+\+IMAGE\+\_\+\+TYPE\+\_\+\+IMAGE\+\_\+2D}} and representing a two-\/dimensional array of texels;
\item a three-\/dimensional image, identified by \mbox{\hyperlink{group__ngf_gga6c69d697d500e6f85fd9b3fe003f177ba10161252c5145974d4379ece3f273904}{NGF\+\_\+\+IMAGE\+\_\+\+TYPE\+\_\+\+IMAGE\+\_\+3D}} and representing a three-\/dimensional array of texels;
\item a cubemap, identified by \mbox{\hyperlink{group__ngf_gga6c69d697d500e6f85fd9b3fe003f177ba9712c8cfdf206c435bbe921111ba22f6}{NGF\+\_\+\+IMAGE\+\_\+\+TYPE\+\_\+\+CUBE}} and representing a collection of six two-\/dimensional texel arrays, each corresponding to a face of a cube.
\end{DoxyItemize}

An image object may actually contain several images of the same type, format and dimensions. Those are referred to as \char`\"{}layers\char`\"{} and images containing more than a single layer are called \char`\"{}layered\char`\"{}, or \char`\"{}image arrays\char`\"{}. Note that a multi-\/layered 2D image is different from a single-\/layered 3D image, because filtering is not performed across levels when sampling it. Also note that layered cubemaps are not supported by all hardware -\/ see \mbox{\hyperlink{structngf__device__capabilities_a6a147874bc17bbac3e00011fd3780e7c}{ngf\+\_\+device\+\_\+capabilities\+::cubemap\+\_\+arrays\+\_\+supported}}.

Each image layer may contain mip levels. Mip level 0 is the layer itself, and each subsequent level (1, 2 and so on) is 2x smaller in dimensions, and usually contains the downscaled version of the preceding level for the purposes of filtering, although the application is free to upload arbitrary data into any mip level, as long as dimension requirements are respected.
