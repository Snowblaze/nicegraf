\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
An opaque handle for a sampler object. ~\newline


Samplers encapsulate how to filter an image -\/ what happens when an image is minified or magnified, whether anisotropic filtering is enabled, etc. See \mbox{\hyperlink{structngf__sampler__info}{ngf\+\_\+sampler\+\_\+info}} for more details.

Samplers can be bound separately from images -\/ in which case the shader code sees them as two distinct objects, and the same sampler can be ussed to sample two different images. They can also be combined into a single descriptor (see \mbox{\hyperlink{group__ngf_gga8a0ef5b45413475065aa68cf8508b835a936f9e18629c082be14a63446f2a00f3}{NGF\+\_\+\+DESCRIPTOR\+\_\+\+IMAGE\+\_\+\+AND\+\_\+\+SAMPLER}}), in which case the shader code sees only a single image object, which can be sampled only one certain way.
