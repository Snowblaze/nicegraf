<div class="textblock"><p >Encodes a series of rendering commands.</p>
<p >Internally, a command buffer may be in any of the following five states:</p><ul>
<li>new;</li>
<li>ready;</li>
<li>recording;</li>
<li>awaiting submission;</li>
<li>submitted.</li>
</ul>
<p >Every newly created command buffer is in the "new" state. It can be transitioned to the "ready" state by calling <a class="el" href="group__ngf.html#ga52027dd2cf70d4530d60edabe5a6019c">ngf_start_cmd_buffer</a> on it.</p>
<p >When a command buffer is in the "ready" state, you may begin recording a new series of rendering commands into it.</p>
<p >Recording commands into a command buffer is performed using command encoders. There are a few different types of encoders, supporting different types of commands.</p>
<p >A new encoder may be created for a command buffer only if the command buffer is in either the "ready" or the "awaiting submission" state.</p>
<p >Creating a new encoder for a command buffer transitions that command buffer to the "recording" state.</p>
<p >Finishing and disposing of an active encoder transitions its corresponding command buffer into the "awaiting submission" state.</p>
<p >The three rules above mean that a command buffer may not have more than one encoder active at a given time.</p>
<p >Once all of the desired commands have been recorded, and the command buffer is in the "awaiting submission" state, the command buffer may be submitted for execution via a call to <a class="el" href="group__ngf.html#ga19a0228d5d5568d37d3a75f1f91353e4">ngf_submit_cmd_buffers</a>, which transitions it into the "submitted" state.</p>
<p >Submission may only be performed on command buffers that are in the "awaiting submission" state.</p>
<p >Once a command buffer is in the "submitted" state, it is impossible to append any new commands to it. It is, however, possible to begin recording a new, completely separate batch of commands by calling <a class="el" href="group__ngf.html#ga52027dd2cf70d4530d60edabe5a6019c">ngf_start_cmd_buffer</a> which implicitly transitions the buffer to the "ready" state if it is already "submitted". This does not affect any previously submitted commands.</p>
<p >Calling a command buffer function on a buffer that is in a state not expected by that function will result in an error. For example, calling <a class="el" href="group__ngf.html#ga19a0228d5d5568d37d3a75f1f91353e4">ngf_submit_cmd_buffers</a> would produce an error on a buffer that is in the "ready" state, since, according to the rules outlined above, <a class="el" href="group__ngf.html#ga19a0228d5d5568d37d3a75f1f91353e4">ngf_submit_cmd_buffers</a> expects command buffers to be in the "awaiting
submission" state. </p>
